# Project: Intro to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
======

### A site created using HTML, CSS, and select Bootstrap classes

### __Written and Designed by Ash Laidlaw__

## Description
------

__The site will include a small portfolio of previous work in HTML and CSS, as well as an "About Me" section.__

## Setup
------

__This project can be found on my GitHub page, which you can reach at https://github.com/Yhbv24 .__

## Known Bugs

__On the "About Me" section, the photo does not center within its element, so it may look strange when resizing the window or viewing on a mobile device.__
* _Bug since fixed_

__When in the "mobile" media screen (768px or smaller), hovering does not seem to change the color of the text.__

__When in the "mobile" media screen (768px or smaller), there is a hyperlink to the index.html page at the very top of the page. Difficult to click, but it's there, and could cause problems.__
